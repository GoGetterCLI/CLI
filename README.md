# Gogetter CLI

This is a tool in development, aimed at helping small developers who don't have the wherewithall for a website have their packages distributed.


### How it works

On our own website, you can upload your package, and someone using the CLI can easily download that very same file. 

### Privacy

Anyone who has the CLI downloaded can download your package. We of course do check for malware when it's uploaded so there's no risk of accidentally getting a virus through
the CLI. The only restrictions on downloading your package is time. You can choose to have the package be unable to be downloaded after a certain amount of time.
